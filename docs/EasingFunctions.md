`EASE_ELASTIC_X` | Allows for an elastic easing effect on the x-axis of a container. <br/> Takes in 4 parameters: <br/> <ol> 1) A step length calculator which controls the easing of the **forward part** of the scroll-animation. <br/> 2) A step length calculator which controls the easing of the **backward part** of the scroll-animation. <br/> 3) A function which must return the number of pixels that will have to be scrolled by the backward part of the scroll-animation. <br/> This function will be passed the following input parameters (in this order): <br/> <ol> - OriginalTimestamp which indicates the exact time in milliseconds at which the forward part of the scroll-animation has started <br/> - Timestamp which indicates the time in milliseconds at which this function is invoked <br/> - CurrentPosition of the container's left border <br/> - Direction, 1 if the elements inside the container have gone from right to left as a consequence of the forward part of the scroll-animation, -1 otherwise <br/> - Container on which the scroll-animation is currently being performed (a DOM element that can be scrolled) <br/> </ol> If this function returns a negative number, the forward easing will be used instead of the backward one. <br/> 4) The time in milliseconds that has to pass after the end of the forward part of the scroll animation to start the backward part </ol>
`EASE_ELASTIC_Y` | Allows for an elastic easing effect on the y-axis of a container. <br/> Takes in 4 parameters: <br/> <ol> 1) A step length calculator which controls the easing of the **forward part** of the scroll-animation. <br/> 2) A step length calculator which controls the easing of the **backward part** of the scroll-animation. <br/> 3) A function which must return the number of pixels that will have to be scrolled by the backward part of the scroll-animation. <br/> This function will be passed the following input parameters (in this order): <br/> <ol> - OriginalTimestamp which indicates the exact time in milliseconds at which the forward part of the scroll-animation has started <br/> - Timestamp which indicates the time in milliseconds at which this function is invoked <br/> - CurrentPosition of the container's top border <br/> - Direction, 1 if the elements inside the container have gone from bottom to top as a consequence of the forward part of the scroll-animation, -1 otherwise <br/> - Container on which the scroll-animation is currently being performed (a DOM element that can be scrolled) <br/> </ol> If this function returns a negative number, the forward easing will be used instead of the backward one. <br/> 4) The time in milliseconds that has to pass after the end of the forward part of the scroll animation to start the backward part </ol>

All the above mentioned methods return a `stepLengthCalculator`. <br/>
Except for `CUSTOM_CUBIC_BEZIER`, `EASE_ELASTIC_X` and `EASE_ELASTIC_Y`, the input parameters are: <br/>  
- A `duration` in milliseconds <br/>
- A `callback` that is executed at every scroll-animation step and that will be invoked with the same input parameters the returned stepLengthCalculators are passed <br/>

`CUSTOM_CUBIC_BEZIER` requires the 4 b√©zier points (finite numbers between 0 and 1) before the `duration` and the `callback`. <br/>
