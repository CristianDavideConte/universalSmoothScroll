# Download
In order to use the USS API you first have to download the needed scripts which you can get in many ways. <br/>

In total, there are two files available:
* `universalsmoothscroll-min.js`                
* `universalsmoothscroll-ease-functions-min.js` 
  
The former is always required and contains _(the minified version of)_ the API itself. <br/> 
The latter is optional instead and contains _(the minified version of)_ an easing-functions library which you may find useful later on. <br/>

Each one of the download options will give you access to all the above described scripts, so choose freely the download method you prefer.

---

## npm
[`npm i universalsmoothscroll@latest`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/universalsmoothscroll) <br/>

All the scripts will be downloaded inside your `node_module` folder.
<br/>

--- 

## jsDelivr
Visit [`jsDelivr`](https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/universalsmoothscroll) and click the download button. <br/>
The files will be saved as a _.tgz archive_: extract them and you're good to go. 
<br/>

---

## Github
Whenever a new version of the API is published, a new release is drafted. <br/>
Each release has a changelog and the latest versions of the above mentioned files attached as assets. <br/>
All the USS API releases are available in the [`releases section`](https://github.com/CristianDavideConte/universalSmoothScroll/releases).
