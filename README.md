![GitHub release (latest by date)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/CristianDavideConte/universalSmoothScroll?color=rgba%2850%2C200%2C80%29&label=Version&logo=github)
![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/universalsmoothscroll?color=rgb%28255%2C50%2C50%29&label=%20Version&logo=npm)

The Universal Smooth Scroll API is a **lightweight and very fast javascript library** that provides an enriched version of the standard `scroll-behavior: smooth` CSS property. <br/>
This scroll API is based on and improves upon the 3 main ways to scroll an element in plain js: `scrollTo()`, `scrollBy()`, `scrollIntoView()`.<br/>
**Every scroll-animation** triggered by the API **can be interrupted** at any moment and **supports user-defined custom ease functions.**<br/>
**Multiple scroll-animations** can be played **at the same time** for 1 or more DOM's elements.<br/>

# Demo
You can try most of the API functionalities on [my personal website](https://cristiandavideconte.github.io/myPersonalWebPage/).<br/>
You can also take a look at how single features are implemented on [this playground](https://cristiandavideconte.github.io/universalSmoothScroll/).

# How to install
## NPM:
`npm i universalsmoothscroll`
## HTML tag:
Add this `<script>` to your project's `<head>`: <br/>
`<script src = "https://raw.githack.com/CristianDavideConte/universalSmoothScroll/master/js/universalsmoothscroll-min.js"></script>`<br/>

To include the support for cubic-bezier ease functions, also add this `<script>` to your project's `<head>`:<br/>
`<script src = "https://raw.githack.com/CristianDavideConte/universalSmoothScroll/master/js/universalsmoothscroll-ease-functions-min.js"></script>`

## Local file:
Download the scripts' minified versions that you can find [here](https://github.com/CristianDavideConte/universalSmoothScroll/releases), move it into your project's js directory & add it/them to your project's `<head>`. <br/>
For example:<br/>
```
<head>
    ...
  <script src = "YOUR_JAVASCRIPT_FOLDER/universalsmoothscroll-min.js"></script>
  <script src = "YOUR_JAVASCRIPT_FOLDER/universalsmoothscroll-ease-functions-min.js"></script> <!-- optional -->
    ...
</head>
```
# How does it work ?
All the API properties are methods of the `uss` object which gets automatically initialized when you import the script into your project.<br/>
The `uss` object is initialized in the global scope of you project so be aware of that !<br/>
The `uss` object has some internal variables which **SHOULD NOT** be directly manipulated: it's suggested to always use the provided getters and setters.<br/>
You will be able to recognize those internal properties because their names begin with an `_` (underscore). <br/>
For istance:
* `uss._xStepLength` is the name of the internal property used by the `uss` object's methods.
* `uss.getXStepLength()` & `uss.setXStepLength()` are the getter and setter for the `uss._xStepLength` variable.<br/>

There are 3 main scrolling-methods:
* `uss.scrollTo()`
* `uss.scrollBy()`
* `uss.scrollIntoView()`<br/>

There's also 1 handy auto-initializer for anchor links:
* `uss.hrefSetup()`<br/>

`scrollIntoView` | Scrolls the window and, if necessary, the container of the passed element in order to make it visible on the screen. <br/> There are 3 possible allignments for both the passed element and it's closest scrollable container: top, bottom, center. <br/> The allignments can be changed by passing different values of alignToTop and alignToLeft.<br/> Works with "overflow('',X,Y): hidden" if specified. <br/> After the scroll-animations have finished a callback function can be invoked.
`stopScrollingX` | Stops all the current scroll-animation on the x-axis of the passed container. <br/> After the animations are stopped a callback function can be invoked.
`stopScrollingY` | Stops all the current scroll-animation on the y-axis of the passed container. <br/> After the animations are stopped a callback function can be invoked.
`stopScrolling` | Stops all the current scroll-animation on both the x-axis and the y-axis of the passed container. <br/> After the animations are stopped a callback function can be invoked.
`hrefSetup` | Looks for every anchor element (`<a>` && `<area>`) with a value for the href attribute linked to an element on the same page and attaches an eventListener(onclick) to it in order to trigger a smooth scroll-animation to reach the linked element (internally uses `scrollIntoView`). <br/> Before the scroll-animations are performed an init function can be invoked. <br/> After the scroll-animations have finished a callback function can be invoked.

# F.A.Q.
## Q: Do I need to have _`scroll-behavior: smooth`_ in my CSS ?
A: NO! It will break the API.
## Q: Can I use the API scrolling methods on containers that have the _`scroll-snap-type`_ CSS property ?
A: NO! They won't work.
## Q: How do I invoke the API methods ?  
A: Every Universal Smooth Scroll API function call has this structure: `uss.NAME_OF_THE_METHOD(ARGUMENTS)`.
## Q: What are _`_scrollX()`_ and _`_scrollY()`_ ?
A: They are functions that can only be internally accessed by the API, you won't be able to invoke them. <br/>
They execute all the instructions needed for a single scroll-animation-step on respectively the x-axis and the y-axis.
## Q: What is the difference between _`stillStart = true`_ and _`stillStart = false`_ ?
A: They produce 2 completly different kind of scroll-animations' behaviors.<br/>
_`stillStart = true`_ means that before the scroll-animation you requested can be played any other scroll-animation on the same axis of the passed container is cancelled so this type of scroll-animations always start from a no-movement situation in order to be performed.<br/>  
_`stillStart = false`_ means that even if other scroll-animations on the same axis of the passed container are currently being performed they won't be cancelled by default, they will just be extended/reduced by the passed delta.<br/>
This is an example of how different these 2 kind of scroll-animations are:<br/>
```javascript
const ourEaseFunction = (remaning, original_timestamp, timestamp, total, currentY, finalY, container) => {return remaning / 15 + 1;};
uss.setYStepLengthCalculator(ourEaseFunction, window);

//CASE A: stillStart = true
const stillStartTrueBehavior = wheelEvent => {
    wheelEvent.preventDefault();
    wheelEvent.stopPropagation();
    uss.scrollYBy(totalScrollAmount(wheelEvent.deltaY), window, null, true);
}

//CASE B: stillStart = false
const stillStartFalseBehavior = wheelEvent => {
    wheelEvent.preventDefault();
    wheelEvent.stopPropagation();
    uss.scrollYBy(totalScrollAmount(wheelEvent.deltaY), window, null, false);
}

//Uncomment one or the other and look at the difference
//window.addEventListener("wheel", stillStartTrueBehavior,   {passive: false});
//window.addEventListener("wheel", stillStartFalseBehavior,  {passive: false});
```
## Q: Can I modify the way scroll-animation steps are calculated to a non-linear behavior ?
A: YES! <br/>
Just use `uss.setXStepLengthCalculator(YOUR_CUSTOM_EASE_FUNCTION, TARGET_CONTAINER)` for the x-axis and `uss.setYStepLengthCalculator(...)` for the y-axis. <br/>
For example:<br/>
```javascript
uss.setYStepLengthCalculator((remaning, original_timestamp, timestamp, total, currentY, finalY, container) => {return remaning / 10 + 1;});
```
<br/>You can also use the standard cubic-bezier ease-functions included in the `universalsmooth-scroll-ease-functions` library that you can find [here](https://github.com/CristianDavideConte/universalSmoothScroll/blob/master/js/universalsmoothscroll-ease-functions.js).<br/>
For istance:<br/>
```javascript
uss.setStepLengthCalculator(EASE_IN_OUT_CUBIC(), myContainer);
```
## Q: Can I make my scroll-animation last a certain amount of time?
A: YES!<br/>
While setting a custom ease function you will notice it will be passed both the timestamp relative to the beginning of the scroll-animation and the current timestamp as the second and third arguments of your function.<br/>
You can use them to make the scroll-animations last any amount of time you want.<br/><br/>
You can also use the standard cubic-bezier ease-functions included in the `universalsmooth-scroll-ease-functions` library that you can find [here](https://github.com/CristianDavideConte/universalSmoothScroll/blob/master/js/universalsmoothscroll-ease-functions.js) which can be used by specifing a duration as the first argument.<br/>
For istance:<br/>
```javascript
uss.setStepLengthCalculator(EASE_LINEAR(2000), myContainer); //Every scroll-animation on our container will last 2 seconds
```
You may find [this](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/Window/requestAnimationFrame) helpful.
## Q: What is the _hrefSetup's_ `init` parameter ?
A: Unlike every other callback parameter of this API, this is a function that gets executed right before any scroll-animation is performed. <br/>
You may want to use this function to execute actions that must happen after an anchor link is clicked but before any scroll-animation is performed. <br/>
For example: <br/>
```javascript
let changeBg = () => document.body.style.backgroundColor = "rgb(" + Math.random() * 255 + "," + Math.random() * 255 + "," + Math.random() * 255 + ")"; //No need to return anything in this case
uss.hrefSetup(true, true, changeBg); //Every time an anchor link is clicked our body's backgroundColor is randomly changed
```
## Q: Why there's no setter for the _`_reducedMotion`_ variable ?
A: Because it's up to the final users to decide which accessibility settings they want to enable. <br/>
Ignoring user preferences is not suggested.   
## Q: Why is it allowed to directly modify internal variables ?
A: It is allowed (but highly discouraged) because there may be a bug that prevents you from setting a variable to a right value (not common). <br/>
